## Hey, I'm Matthew 👋

Third year Maths student at Durham (predicted First, ~85% average) trying to figure out how to price things and predict things. Sometimes both at once.

## Background

Interned at Google DeepMind working on efficient financial NLP pipelines, transformer benchmarking, and explainability (SHAP, LIME, GradCAM). Won best research award at TAROS 2025 for that work.

Studying mathematical finance, stochastic processes, machine learning & neural networks, and decision theory. Currently working on a final year project on reinforcement learning and optimal policy control. Interested in quantitative research and trading. 

## Tech

Python, R | PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Git, LaTeX

Comfortable with Monte Carlo methods, transformer models, statistical modeling, advanced probability, and numerical simulation.

## Projects

Currently building a flight price prediction tool. Otherwise usually working on something involving ML or quantitative finance. Check my repos to see what's currently broken.
